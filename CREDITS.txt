This is where I say thank you to all of the people who helped me along the way, either with code, setting up the code or helping with the graphics!
---Setting up---
-A big thank you to Ortho, Nentify and MeanTomatoes. You helped me set up Java and whatever, and you guys rock!
---Code---
A thank you to Pahimar, who helped me learn MC's code. He probably wont read this, but thank you! 
Another big thank you to ToffeeMax, who has cleaned up, put comments in and otherwise been a great help, who I am sure will continue to help as we leave Indev and enter Alpha!
---Graphics---
A thank you to Recon, who made the logo which can be found inside the mcmod.info file
A thank you to JujuBeans, who will be making the tool textures and I am sure they will be great!
