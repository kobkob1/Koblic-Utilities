#Contributing
So you wanna help? Huh? Well thats great! We always like help :D Help is always great so all you have to do is submit a Pull Request with a little comment about your code!
Bug fixes are always welcomed, but just general clean up of formatting can be seen as/ is rude! Feature Implementation is nice however please leave a Issue saying what you would like to implement.
Nothing is worse than putting hours of code in, and for having it rejected.

#Help
Developers are people... so dont be rude and spam! It does take time...
